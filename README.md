# Abstractive-Tweet-Summarization

This project focuses on developing an innovative solution for Abstractive Tweet Summarization using the powerful Pegasus model. The goal is to generate concise and coherent summaries of sets of tweets related to trending topics on Twitter. By fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Pegasus model with a custom dataset obtained through web scraping, the system achieves improved accuracy and can distill the essence of multiple tweets into an abstractive prose summary.

Key Features:

* Web scraping using Python to collect a diverse dataset of tweets on trending topics.
* Fine-tuning the Pegasus model to generate abstractive summaries from the tweet dataset.
* Leveraging transfer learning to enhance the model's ability to produce accurate and coherent summaries.
* Implementing efficient preprocessing pipelines to prepare the tweet data for training.
